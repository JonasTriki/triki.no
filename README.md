# triki.no

My personal website, made with Svelte and deployed using Vercel :rocket:

## Prerequisites

To develop and run this application, [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed. I personally recommend using a version manager, such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Installing

To install the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

To start a development sever locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
